# Neuromorphic Architectures

## Background
In this directory is an exploration of several popular neuromorphic (NM) architectures popularized by the likes of Pentti Kanerva and other researchers over the past few decades. One can find several different models with practical applications of each model.

I will attach some readings to familiarize oneself with the field and these models.
